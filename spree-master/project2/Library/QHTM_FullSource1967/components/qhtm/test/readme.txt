This application is a simple test tool.

I'd like to add more tests for QHTM but, using the "demo" as my test
platform meant I had to be careful with it (so not to break it).

Hopefully I'll use this tool as the platform for my tests instead of
using the Demo - this should mean more test will be run and a better
QHTM will be the end result.

The only QHTM window we want is the main window. This means debugging is
easier as we can add the minimum HTML need to see an event and set a break
point on the event...tempting though it is to use QHTM for the entire
interface.
