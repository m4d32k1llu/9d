	<h3>QHTM Development Stuff</h3>
	<p>QHTM is written entirely in C++. It has an extensible hierarchy of classes that mean adding new object capabilities is fairly simple.</p>
	<p>QHTM is tuned using Numega's TrueTime profiler and it is run through Numega's BoundsChecker prior to being released.
	<p>All code is written with level four warnings and warnings as errors using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0.

	<h3>About the author</h3>
	<p>I've been a commercial software developer since around 1990. Prior to that I was just hacking in 6502 assembler just because it was 'fun'. I sold some stuff to computer magazines back in the 80's when personal computers were not PC's.
