	<h4>Links</h4>

	<p>Links, as you would expect, you can have links to web sites outside of your aplication. Such as <a href="http://www.gipsysoft,com/">this one</a>. Of course images work as links too.

	<h4>Link tips</h4>
	Hyperlinks get tooltips displayed which by default is the URL. You can override this by specifying a <code>title=""</code>. For example <a href="http://www.gipsysoft.com/" title="<b><font color=red>Click here</font></b> to visit GipsySoft.com">this link will display</a> the HTML message box in action but the link is internal and is quite ugly. Hover the mouse cursor over the link to see what happens. Yup, you can even have HTML in the tooltips!
	
	<h4>Internal links</h4>
	<p>Links can also be interpreted internally so rather than opening a web browser they do something instead your application.
	<p><a href="#bottom"><b>Click here</b></a> to view the bottom of this HTML file.

	<p>And links can be used to navigate to otehr parts of a document. This requires no callback and QHTM handles everything.
	<p><a href="#top"><b>Click here</b></a> to go back up to the top.
